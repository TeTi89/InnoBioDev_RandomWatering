### image masking
problems:
1. The photos were taken under different lighting conditions. Mainly in warm or cold light.
2. Some images cannot be displayed correctly. Part of the image consists of a monochrome block.
3. Almost all the pictures were taken too close to the object (in this case plants) so that the camera loses focus.
4. In most cases, the flower pots are not in the center of the picture. As a result, the circular shape of the flower pots is not fully depicted in the image area. This makes it difficult to recognize the circle. 
5. Many of the pictures showed more than just a flower pot.
6. Some flower pots are still equipped with sensors. The sensors must also be recognized. To prevent the sensors from being watered.
